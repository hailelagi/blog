Hey reader, I'm Haile Lagi the main author of this blog,  I'm 18, Ethiopian-Nigerian, unfortunately weird and probably half sane at best. This is the world of a travelling ghost, here you can read about everything from [poetry](https://atimetravellingghost.wordpress.com/2016/10/06/im-sorryyesterday-promised-hes-such-a-terrible-liar/), science, philosophy and all manner of fiction, to more random off hand topics. But mostly we're just in love with ideas and conversation. Supposedly you're just passing by at random, that's okay so am I, so is everyone in an all too cliche metaphysical sense. Hope you stick around and read something. Click on the [blog](https://atimetravellingghost.wordpress.com/blog/) tab and become a ghost too. :)
