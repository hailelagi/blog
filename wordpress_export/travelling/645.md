Hey, I'm Haile. It's been several months, possibly years since I last posted on this blog. Undoubtedly whatever scraps of an audience I once had will most likely be gone. In a way this is my whisper into the infinity, a quiet speech, a soliloquy in the darkest recesses of the internet proudly hosted by Wordpress ðŸ™‚. A lot has happened since I last posted here. A LOT. Quite Frankly I don't even know why exactly it is I am posting here, maybe it's nostalgia, maybe I miss my "projects" lol and all the direction and focus they had given me in my life.
