Yet in a true sense, it's not the end, it's a beginning too. The end of everything that was this blog ended a long time ago, it bore seeds in its beginning that marked eventual destruction. Even then, it's not really a beginning or an end, simply another phase. Yes, that's the word I'm searching for, a marked phase to show where continuous change is marked by a significant distortion noticeable enough to the keen observant eye and yet marked as nothing at all. I could go into details, explaining every facet and possible reasoning as to why I discontinued this blog long ago. I could explain the events that lead to its creation and I could explain the events that occurred in my life many many years ago. Facing pure absurdity, consumed living the reality of my little books I forgot something simple.

> **Life** can only be understood backwards, but it **must be lived forwards**. -Soren Kierkegaard

Here I am, once again living forward, understanding how I got to be here and of my past decisions and choices. Goodbye, travelling ghosts, we are all strangers and our memories will turn into ghosts that haunt us in the ultimate passage of time. -Haile Lagi
