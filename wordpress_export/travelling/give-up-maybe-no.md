Hey, It's time for a little short heart to heart :) a little while back I decided to completely abandon my blog(it wasn't public I just stopped posting), not blogging entirely per se, but this blog in particular for various reasons and the biggest is probably engagement, most of my target audience simply didn't "get" my ideas or what I'm trying to accomplish. I suppose a whole host of  other [reasons](https://atimetravellingghost.wordpress.com/2016/10/11/content-content-contentmy-paradox-of-reach/)  I had foreseen are major factors and in my attempt(admittedly failed) to correct this I [tried](https://atimetravellingghost.wordpress.com/2016/11/02/house-cleaning/)  a buncha new stuff here and there, but it just didn't do the trick. So I figured hey what the heck, I've got a million things on my mind and my projects' workload can barely keep up with myself, so whatever I'll just GIVE UP. But something doesn't feel quite right, something's telling me to keep going, to keep tweaking, to keep at it... I don't know, maybe I'm crazy, but I want to try this path of perseverance, as I realize it maybe pointless, somehow I'm willing enough to hang on for just a little bit. All the best, truly -Atravellingghost
