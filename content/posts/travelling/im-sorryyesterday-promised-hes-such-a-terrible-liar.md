A trifling affair, a rather inconsistent love fair But nonetheless a tortured promise of a hero's care, Not one but two monsters, all he did was snare But the fragile heart couldn't bear Not truth,this love affair. Threescores for the hero, Not one will know my fear Lies,lies unto the pages I the ghost saw the misery in his despair, Pity I did not and off I killed his heir. Oh, dreary wonder his heart spoke of things beyond repair, Regret filled his every tear in my care But not one of three ghosts did dare For a moment was lost,any sooner gone With neither reason nor cause but revere.
